# WoW Wiki

### What is this?

This is a dedicated wiki for World of Warcraft game version. It would be also an historical archive of original content from all expansion.

### Why are you using github? instead of mediawiki or similar platform?

Because we believe that the Open Source tools together the wiki concept allow us to create a repository of information that can never die
thankfully to git, github and the fork system.

In fact you can even [download](https://github.com/wowgame/wiki-wotlk-en/zipball/master) the whole wiki without lose anything. Every page here is a static file with an human readable markdown syntax.

Moreover anyone can collaborate to this project , such as on a real mediawiki platform.

It's based on the [git wiki project](https://github.com/drassil/git-wiki)

### Why we should use it instead of other wow wiki platforms?

Because they can be closed suddenly, as a lot of other similar projects out of there, and you have not the possibility to recover that data.
This wiki instead, as said before, can be easily entirely downloaded in just 1 click and you can reupload it on every [free] host that support web static files (everyone).

So please, help us to improve this wiki, even a small contribute can make the difference!

Thank you!

The WoWGame Team.
