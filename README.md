# wiki-wotlk

### What is this?

This is a dedicated wiki for Wrath of the lich king game version. Would be an historical archive of original content from Wotlk expansion.

### Why are you using github? instead of mediawiki or similar platform?

Because we believe that the Open Source tools together the wiki concept allow us to create a repository of information that can never die
thankfully to git, github and the fork system.

In fact you can even download the whole wiki without lose anything. Every page here is a static file with an human readable markdown syntax.

Moreover anyone can collaborate to this project , such as on a real mediawiki platform.
