## Emulation

Emulated servers, informally referred to as "private servers", are third-party (user-created) offline game servers for online games which do not normally support the use of such servers. This is not to be confused with games which support third-party servers as a normal feature, such as any number of first-person shooters. Playing on emulated servers through the use of Blizzard's WoW client is a breach of the World of Warcraft End-User License Agreement, which requires the user to agree not to connect to unauthorized emulated servers
